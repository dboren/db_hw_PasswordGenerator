Pseudocode

If button is clicked
    Prompt appears for inputing length of password (8-128)
        When number is submitted, passwordLength variable is created with
                that value
    
    Then prompt appears for selecting whether to include lowercase
        When yes or no is submitted, assign true or false to hasLowercase variable

    Then prompt appears for selecting wti uppercase
        When y or n is submitted, assign true or false to hasUppercase variable

    Then prompt appears for selecting wti numbers
        When y or n is submitted, assign true or false to hasNumbers variable

    Then prompt appears for selecting wti spec chars
        When y or n is submitted, assign true or false to hasSpecChars variable

Create four modular character set arrays

    LowerCase array [a-z]
    UpperCase array [A-Z]
    Numbers array [0-9]
    SpecChar array [special characters]

If user has not approved any character types, alert them "at least one valid character type required"

If LowerCase is not approved, its array = ""
If UpperCase is not approved, its array = ""
If Numbers are not approved, its array = ""
if SpecChar are not approved, its array = ""

Array to be used by char selector function generated by concatenating all 4 arrays in order

Function using math.random() method and += operand to compile randomly selected indices of final array into
        password of length determined by user input.
